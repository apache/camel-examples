== Camel Example Main Lambda

This example demonstrates how to use `LambdaRouteBuilder` as a way of defining Camel routes
using lambda style.

[source,java]
----
rb -> rb.from("timer:foo").log("Hello Lambda");
----

The `LambdaRouteBuilder` is a functional interface that makes defining routes with lambda style
easy. All you need to do is to create a method that returns `LambdaRouteBuilder` and mark
the method with `@BindToRegistry` or if using Spring Boot `@Bean` or `@Produce` for CDI/Quarkus.

See the `MyConfiguration.java` for the configuration and Camel routes are set up.

Multiple routes can be defined by having multiple methods.

=== Build

=== How to run
