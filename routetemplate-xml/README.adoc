== Camel Example Route Template in XML

This examples shows how to use Route Templates (parameterized routes) to specify a skeleton route
which can be used for creating and adding new routes via parameters in pure XML.

The route template is defined via XML DSL (RouteBuilder) in the resource `templates/my-route-templates.xml`.

The resource `builders/my-template-builder.xml` is used to create two routes from the template using different set of parameters by leveraging the XML DSL.

The example runs standalone via Camel Main in the `MyApplication.java` source file.
