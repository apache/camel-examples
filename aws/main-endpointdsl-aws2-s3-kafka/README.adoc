== Camel Example Main Endpoint DSL with AWS2 S3 component to Kafka

This example shows how to use the endpoint DSL in your Camel routes
to define endpoints using type safe fluent builders, which are Java methods
that are compiled.

The example will poll an S3 bucket and send this to a Kafka topic.

Notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

This example will use the AWS default credentials Provider: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html
Set your credentials accordingly.
Don't forget to add the bucket name and point to the correct topic.

First compile the example by executing:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile

=== How to run

You can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----
