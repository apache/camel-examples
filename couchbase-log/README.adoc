== Camel Main Example Couchbase

This example shows how to use the Camel Main module
to define a route from Couchbase to Log.

Set your `application.properties` options correctly.
You'll need also a running Couchbase server.

First run the container

[source,sh]
----
docker run -d --name db -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase:7.0.3
----

Now go to `localhost:8091` and create a new cluster with username/password admin/password

Use the sample bucket beer-sample to populate the bucket.

----
$ mvn compile
----

Now you're ready to run the example.
