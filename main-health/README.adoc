== Camel Example Main Health

This example shows how to use Camel health-check in standalone mode.
The example shows how you can build custom health-checks and have
them automatic discovered by Camel and used as parts of its health-check system.

The example has two routes, a timer that calls a bean that flips a boolean that
causes the custom health check to be in either UP or DOWN state.

The 2nd route is on purpose made to fail on startup by configuring Netty to an unknown host.
Camel supervising route controller will attempt to restart the route up till 10 times before exhausting.

The route's health check will therefore report this route as DOWN until its exhausted
where the states are changed to UNKNOWN.

The details can be seen at runtime via JMX.

First compile the example by executing:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== How to run

You can run this example using

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn camel:run

=== JMX Management

find the `DefaultHealthCheck` MBean.
