== Camel Example Main Tiny

The example uses the `camel-core-engine` as dependency to use as few JARs
on the classpath as possible. For more details see the `pom.xml` file.

This example shows how to run Camel standalone via the built-in Main class.

Notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

=== How to run

You can run this example using

    mvn camel:run
