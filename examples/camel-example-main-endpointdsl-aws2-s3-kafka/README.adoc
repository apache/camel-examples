== Camel Example Main Endpoint DSL with AWS2 S3 component to Kafka

This example shows how to use the endpoint DSL in your Camel routes
to define endpoints using type safe fluent builders, which are Java methods
that are compiled.

The example will poll an S3 bucket and send this to a Kafka topic.

Notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

Don't forget to add your AWS Credentials and the bucket name and point to the correct topic.

=== How to run

You can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----
