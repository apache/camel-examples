== Camel Example Kamelet Chuck Norris

=== Introduction

This example shows how you can build a simple Kamelet and use with your Camel applications.

The Kamelet is created as a YAML file in the `src/main/resources/kamelets' directory.
We have developed a Chuck Norris Kamelet that periodically gets a joke from the Chuck Norris internet database.

A Camel routes is _coded_ in the `my-route.xml` file using the XML DSL that uses the Kamelet,
and log the result from the Kamelet to the console.
