== Camel Example Flight Recorder

=== Introduction

This example demonstrates how to integrate Camel with Java Flight Recorder
which can be used to diagnose your JVM applications.

In JDK Mission Control (visualisation tool for flight recorder), you can browse Camel events
which for example can help diagnose problems with slow startup of Camel routes.

=== How to run

You can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----

And then after Camel has been started up, a recording is saved to disk (current directory), where you can see
from the logs the location of the file, such as:

    Flight recorder recording saved: ./camel-recording13093057117733087947.jfr

You can then open this `jfr` file in JDK Mission Control and browse the information.
In the Event Browser you can find the Camel Startup events, which can help pin-point to where
Camel is slow to startup.

NOTE: The recording is started when Camel is bootstrapped, and therefore not from the very beginning of the JVM.
To capture from the JVM beginning you can run java with `-XX:StartFlightRecording`.

=== Using logger instead of flight recorder

Instead of capturing a recording you can configure Camel to log the startup steps instead by setting

    camel.main.startup-recorder = logging

In the `application.properties` file.
