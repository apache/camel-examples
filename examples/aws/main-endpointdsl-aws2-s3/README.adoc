== Camel Example Main Endpoint DSL with AWS2 S3 component

This example shows how to use the endpoint DSL in your Camel routes
to define endpoints using type safe fluent builders, which are Java methods
that are compiled.

The example will poll an S3 bucket and Log the content of the file.

Notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

This example will use the AWS default credentials Provider: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html
Set your credentials accordingly.
Don't forget to add the bucket name.
