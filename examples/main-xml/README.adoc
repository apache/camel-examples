== Camel Example Main XML

This example shows how to run Camel standalone (XML routes) via the built-in Main class.

The route is located in `src/main/resources/routes` as an XML file.

This example has been enabled with live reload, so while the Camel
application is running, then you can edit the route in the XML file,
and when saved Camel will auto update the route(s).

The application is configured in the `application.properties` file.

=== How to run

You can run this example using

    mvn camel:run
