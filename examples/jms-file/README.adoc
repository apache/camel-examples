== JMS & File Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to work with files and JMS.

The example consumes messages from a queue and writes them to the file
system.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== Run

The example should run if you type

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn exec:java
----

After the example is complete, then there should be 10 files written in
the directory `target/messages`.
