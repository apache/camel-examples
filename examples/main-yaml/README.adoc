== Camel Example Main YAML

This example shows how to run Camel standalone (YAML routes) via the built-in Main class.

The route is located in `src/main/resources/routes` as an YAML file.

This example has been enabled with live reload, so while the Camel
application is running, then you can edit the route in the YAML file,
and when saved Camel will auto update the route(s).

The application is configured in the `application.properties` file.

=== Build

First compile the example by executing:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== How to run

You can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----
