== Camel Example Kamelet YAML

=== Introduction

This example shows how to use ready to use Kamelets you can find at the
https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/latest/[Camel Kamelet Catalog].

We are using the _Earthquake Source_ Kamelet which we have downloaded and stored
in the `src/main/resources/kamelet` directory.

Then we added the needed Camel components (you can find the list inside the kamelet YAML file).

A Camel routes is _coded_ in the `my-camel.yaml` file using the YAML DSL that uses the kamelet,
and log the result from the kamelet to the console.

The example has no Java code at all, and is started via Camel's own `Main` class from `camel-main` JAR.
