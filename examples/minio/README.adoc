== Camel MinIO Example

This example shows how to use Camel MinIO component to write and read objects in a bucket.

The example has 2 routes :

* the producer : put a file in a MinIO bucket
* the consumer : poll a MinIO bucket and Log the content of the file.

Notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

Don't forget to add your MinIO Credentials and the bucket name.

=== Run a MinIO instance

You need to have an instance of MinIO server running locally.

You can run it as a Docker container:

[source,sh]
----
docker run \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=xxxx" \
    -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=yyyyyyyy"  \
    quay.io/minio/minio server /data  \
    --console-address ":9090"
----

First compile the example by executing:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
