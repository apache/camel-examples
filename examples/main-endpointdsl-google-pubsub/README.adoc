== Camel Example Google PubSub Endpoint DSL

This example shows how to use the endpoint DSL in your Camel routes
to define endpoints using type safe fluent builders, which are Java methods
that are compiled.

Notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

=== Setting up the google pubsub topic

- You'll need to
 - Create a project and save the projectId
 - Create a topic and save the name
 - Create a subscription to that topic and save the subscription name

- Update the application.properties accordingly

=== Build

First compile the example by executing:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== How to run

You can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----
