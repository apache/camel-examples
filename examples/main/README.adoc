== Camel Example Main

This example shows how to run Camel standalone via the built-in Main class.
The example also demonstrates how you can configure the Camel application
via Camel built-in dependency-injection that supports binding via the
`@BindToRegistry`, `@BeanInject` and `@PropertyInject` annotations.

Also notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

=== Alternative example

The class `StandaloneCamel` is an alternative example that provides a
_public static void main_ method and where you manually set up Camel without
any help from Camel's built-in Main class. However, it shows how to do this
in a _raw style_ without using any _magic_.

=== Build

First compile the example by executing:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----

=== Camel CLI

This application is integrated with the Camel CLI via the `camel-cli-connector` dependency (see `pom.xml`).
This allows to use the Camel CLI to manage this application, such as:

    $mvn package camel:run

And then use the CLI to see status:

    $camel get
      PID   NAME                          CAMEL            PLATFORM  READY  STATUS   AGE  TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  SINCE-LAST
     90491  org.apache.camel.example.Myâ€¦  3.19.0-SNAPSHOT  Camel      1/1   Running  20s     11       0         0          0s


=== How to configure for Camel Textual Route debugging

Several IDEs are providing support for Camel Textual Route debugging. To enable this possibility, you need to launch this example with the profile `camel.debug`.

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run -Pcamel.debug
----

This profile can also be activated with camel.debug property set to true. For instance, by setting the property from command-line:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run -Dcamel.debug=true
----
