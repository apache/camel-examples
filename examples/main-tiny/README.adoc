== Camel Example Main Tiny

The example uses the `camel-core-engine` as dependency to use as few JARs
on the classpath as possible. For more details see the `pom.xml` file.

This example shows how to run Camel standalone via the built-in Main class.

Notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

=== Build

First compile the example by executing:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile

=== How to run

You can run this example using

----
$ mvn camel:run
----
