== Camel Main Example Kafka to Azure Storage Blob

This example shows how to use the Camel Main module
to define a route from Kafka to Azure Storage blob

The example will poll one kafka topic and upload single message as blob into an Azure Storage Blob Container.

Set your application.properties options correctly.
You'll need also a running kafka broker.

=== How to run

You can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----

Now send a message to your Kafka broker direct to the Kafka topic set in application.properties

You should see the container populated.
