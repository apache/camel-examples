== Camel Cassandraql route on Kubernetes cluster

This quickstart run in a Java standalone container, using Spring with
Apache Camel (Cassandraql component).

This example is based on:

* Minikube 1.11.0 (Kubernetes version >= 1.17)
* https://www.eclipse.org/jkube[Eclipse JKube]

First thing you'll need to do is to prepare the environment.

Don't forget to use a bit more memory for your Minikube setup to run this
example smoothly:

[source,sh]
----
$ minikube start --memory 5120 --cpus=4
----

Once your Minikube node is up and running you'll need to run the
following command. In your `src/main/resource/jkube/` folder you'll find
two yaml files. Run the following commands using them to prepare the Cassandra cluster:

----
$ kubectl create -f src/main/resources/jkube/cassandra-service.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/main/resources/jkube/cassandra-statefulset.yaml
----

To check the correct startup of the cluster run the following command:

----
$ kubectl get statefulsets.apps
NAME        READY   AGE
cassandra   2/2     3h44m
----

and check the status of the pods

----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cassandra-0                                1/1       Running   0          2h
cassandra-1                                1/1       Running   0          2h
----

You can also verify the health of your cluster by running

----
$ kubectl exec <pod_name> -it nodetool status
Datacenter: DC1-K8Demo

----

=== Building and running

Navigate to the project folder where the example can be built with

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn clean -Pkubernetes-install k8s:deploy
----

When the example runs in Kubernetes, you can use the Kubectl command tool
to inspect the status

To list all the running pods:

[source,sh]
----
$ kubectl get pods
----

You can follow the log for the created Pod by running:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn -Pkubernetes-install k8s:log
----

You should then see an output similar to this:
