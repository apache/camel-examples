== Camel Example Route Template

This examples shows how to use Route Templates (parameterized routes) to specify a skeleton route
which can be used for creating and adding new routes via parameters.

The route template is defined via Java or XML DSL (RouteBuilder) in the `MyRouteTemplates.java` source file.

The `application.properties` is used to create two routes from the template using different set of parameters.

An alternative to create routes is from Java which is done in the `MyTemplateBuilder.java` class thanks to the Java DSL.
See the `MyApplication.java` where you can change the source to use java instead of property file for the template parameters.

The example runs standalone via Camel Main in the `MyApplication.java` source file.
