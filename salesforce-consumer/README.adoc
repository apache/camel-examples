== Salesforce Streaming API Example

This example shows how to use Salesforce Streaming API.

=== Configuring Salesforce
This examples uses OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token Flow, which requires 3 credentials collected from Salesforce - `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Refresh Token`. You will need to put your own credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

NOTE: You might want to sign up with your own Developer account at developer.salesforce.com. After you have done that, you’ll need to create a Connected Application for your integration.

NOTE: This was written with Salesforce Lightening user interface. Classic user interface might have slightly different menu and/or workflow.

Here is an example workflow of creating a Connected Application and get required credentials. For more details, please check Salesforce online manual
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=extend_code_overview.htm&type=5

==== Creating a Connected Application
. Go to `PLATFORM TOOLS > Apps > App Manager` in a navigation tree at the left of Salesforce Setup screen
. Click `New Connected App` button at the upper right
. Enter `camelk_knative_source_salesforce` for Connected App Name
. Enter your email address for Contact Email
. Check Enable OAuth Settings
. Enter `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success` for Callback URL
. Choose 2 OAuth scopes, `Access and manage your data (api)` and `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`, then click Add button
. Click Save button and then click Continue button
. You will be redirected to `Manage Connected Apps` page. `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret` are available in API section. Use `Consumer Key` as a `Client ID` and `Consumer Secret` as a `Client Secret`.
. Go to `PLATFORM TOOLS > Apps > Connected Apps > Manage Connected Apps`
. Click `Edit` next to the `camelk_knative_source_salesforce`
. In OAuth Policies section,
.. Choose `Relax IP restrictions` for IP Relaxation
.. Choose `Refresh token is valid until revoked`
. Click `Save`

==== Getting an OAuth refresh token
In your browser go to the URL, with substituting the `__YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE__` with your connected application Consumer Key:

```
https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&redirect_uri=https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success&display=touch
```

Allow access to the application, and you’ll end up on a page with `refresh_token`, something like:

```
https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success#access_token=..&refresh_token=<refresh_token>&instance_url=...&issued_at=...&signature=...&scope=...&token_type=Bearer
```


=== How to run

You can run this example using

----
$ mvn compile camel:run
----

=== Custom topic name and operation flags

You can specify your topic name (`salesforce.topic`) and turn on/off each operation to be notified (for example, set true for `camel.component.salesforce.config.notifyForOperationCreate` to receive Contact created event) in `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
