== Camel Example Kamelet Main

=== Introduction

This example shows how to use ready to use Kamelets that you can find at the
https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/next/[Camel Kamelet Catalog].

The application is run with `KameletMain` class from camel-kamalet-main JAR.
This makes it easy to run Camel standalone with Kamelet that can be automatically
downloaded from github, and to use YAML DSL for creating Camel routes that use the Kamelets.
The example has no Java code at all.

A Camel routes is _coded_ in the `my-route.yaml` file using the YAML DSL that uses the Kamelet,
and log the result from the Kamelet to the console.
