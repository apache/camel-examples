== Spring & Pulsar Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to work with the Camel-Pulsar Component.

The example consumes messages from a topic and invoke the bean with the
received message.

You can run the Pulsar cluster through docker:

----
$ docker run --rm -it \
  -p 6650:6650 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $PWD/target/data:/pulsar/data \
  apachepulsar/pulsar \
  bin/pulsar standalone
----

The Server is required to be running when you try the client.

And for the Client we use the ProducerTemplate ala Spring
Template style.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

----
$ mvn compile
----

=== Run

The example should run if you type:

==== Step 1: Run Server

----
$ mvn exec:java -PCamelServer
----

==== Step 2: Run Clients

----
$ mvn exec:java -PCamelClient
----
