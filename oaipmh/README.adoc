== Apache OAIPMH Example

This example shows how to use the consumer and producer component to harvest data from a repository using the OAIPMH protocol. The repository to be harvested is ArXiv, which contains preprint information for scientific articles and is widely known on the web. The example first queries the collections available in the repository. From the available collections, it filters those that are identified as "Mathematics" and from their identifier it extracts the titles of the publications contained in this collection.
